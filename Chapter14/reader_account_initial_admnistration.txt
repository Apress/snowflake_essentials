In this example below we created a READER_WH_RM resource monitor to monitor and suspend the READER_WH we just created above on the reader account.  This resource monitor has a credit limit of 5 credits over one calendar month.  The resource monitor named READER_WH_RM has three settings of 90% notify the ACCOUNTADMIN, at 95% of the 5 credits it will suspend after query at 90% and it will suspend immediately at 100% usage of 5 credits.  Remember, resource monitors currently are very limited on who they can notify.  Also, you must make sure you set yourself up for notifications on this Reader Account to get them. See Notifications setting at the reader account:  https://<account_name>.snowflakecomputing.com/console#/preferences
